## Data Structure Changes

### Attendee Data (Before)

```typescript
{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  company: string;
  jobTitle: string;
}
```

### Attendee Data (After)

```typescript
{
  attendees: Array<{
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    email: string;
    phone: string;
    company: string;
    jobTitle: string;
  }>;
  primaryAttendee: { ... }; // First attendee (for compatibility)
  // Also spreads first attendee fields at root level
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  company: string;
  jobTitle: string;
}
```

---

## User Experience Improvements

### Before

1. Hero "Get Your Tickets Now" → Scroll to section → Click "Buy Ticket" → Open sheet
2. Reset button in two separate locations (hero + mobile)
3. Order summary was view-only (no actions)
4. Single attendee form regardless of ticket quantity
5. Manual navigation to payment

### After

1. Hero "Get Your Tickets Now" → Opens sheet directly + scrolls
2. Reset button in one consistent location (order summary)
3. Order summary has two action buttons (Complete Payment + Reset)
4. Multi-page attendee form matching ticket quantity
5. Automatic flow progression with clear navigation

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Reset button appears in order summary
- [x] Reset button shows confirmation dialog
- [x] Complete Payment button triggers checkout
- [x] Hero "Get Your Tickets Now" opens ticket sheet
- [x] Multiple participants: 1 ticket = 1 form page
- [x] Multiple participants: 3 tickets = 3 form pages
- [x] Navigation between attendee forms works
- [x] Previous button on first attendee goes back to tickets
- [x] All attendee data is saved when navigating

---

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are backward compatible!

The attendee form still spreads the first attendee's data at the root level, so existing payment/email code will continue to work.
